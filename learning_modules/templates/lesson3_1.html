<div class="lesson_wrapper">
<p>So in the last lesson we learned about the chromatic scale and how it basically just goes to the next note.<br>
    From here on out our scales will have patterns but in order to understand that you need to understand<br>
    the difference between a Tone and a Semitone.</p>
<h3>Difference between a Tone and a Semitone</h3>
<p>Remember the image of the piano keys? If not, here you go.</p>

<p>Let's focus on the natural notes (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)<br>
    Every space between notes is called a <b>half step.</b> Know this word because we will be using it from now on.<br>
    So C --> C#/Db is considered a half step. Now what if you want to go from C --> D? It can be two half steps or<br>
    we can call it by it's name, a <b>Whole Step.</b> Remember this name as well.<br>
    So D --> E is a whole step but E --> F is only a half step. Why do B --> C and E --> F have no accidentals?<br>
    That is another discussion that we will tackle later on.</p>
