            Alright time for our second scale.

        <h3>
            How to create a major scale
        </h3>

        <p>
            Remember how we created our chromatic scales? Just simply move up by one <b>semitone/half step.</b> The Major Scale takes<br>
            a bit more thinking. So first of all, <b>each guitar fret is a semitone, moving up one or down is a half step,<br>
            moving two semitones/two frets == tone/whole step.</b><br>
            Having established those basic building blocks here is the formula for any major scale.<br>
            <b>(Whole step - Whole step - half step - Whole step - Whole step - Whole step - half step) ==
            (W - W - h - W - W - W - h)</b>
        </p>

        <h3>C Major Scale</h3>

        <p>
            Knowing the formula, let's learn our C Major Scale.</p>

        <p>
            Now let's look at how this translates on to the fretboard.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Major Scale 6th String Root
        </h3>

        <div id="major_scale_6th_root">

            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/major_scale_6th_string.jpeg' %}">

        </div>

        <p>
            Okay, same approach as the chromatic scale with one difference. Notice how the whole scale falls within<br>
            a four fret area? So what do you finger do you begin on the root note (friendly reminder, you begin on
            the<br>
            bottom most row, because that is the 6th/low E string)? You want to place your middle finger on that root
            note.<br>
            Why? It behooves you to do so because once you reach the 5th/A string you need that pointer finger to hit a
            fret<br>
            lower than your root note. Another friendly reminder: This shape is mobile, that means that you can play it
            anywhere<br>
            on the fretboard, so long as you have the frets available to play the scale, this includes the open strings.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Major Scale 5th Root
        </h3>

        <p>
            From here on out you will probably get two versions of the same scale. The second version of the scale will
            be the<br>
            same scale but it will begin from the 5th/A string in order to give you more options. Practice both equally.
        </p>

        <div id="major_scale_5th_root">

            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/major_scale_5th_string.jpeg' %}">

        </div>

        <p>
            Okay before you freak out about how many frets this covers let's go over some best practices for guitar
            playing.<br>
            First and foremost, these rules are here to help you out, but remember, this is music, we go over the
            rules<br>
            to break them later one when we know what we are doing. Secondly, you want to avoid playing two back to back
            different<br>
            notes with the same finger. That is to say we will maneuver our fingers to avoid making one finger do a lot
            of work.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>How To Play It!</b><br>

            Remember how on the chromatic scale your hand position slid down one fret in order to play the four notes on
            the next<br>
            string? When it comes to these patterns more than four fret patterns we will almost always change hand
            position.<br>
            Same concept as the one above, start with your middle finger on the 5th/A string. Play it as you normally
            would,<br>
            but when you get to the 3rd/G string right before the root note, you will want to play the root note with
            your<br>
            pointer finger and that is the transition. So to reiterate, rather than playing the second root note with
            your pinky<br>
            finger, you will want to move your hand position to allow you to play that root note with your pointer
            finger, then<br>
            follow the rest of the pattern.
        </p>

        <p>
            When descending on the pattern the shift will be similar, when you get to the root note on the 3rd string,
            <br>
            play the root note with your pointer finger then shift your hand so that you play the next note with you
            ring<br>
            finger and continue descending.
        </p>

        <p>
            IMPORTANT NOTE: The idea with these 5th root patterns with hand position shifts is to allow the player to
            <br>
            reach higher notes but it should sound like there is no shift in hand position. My advice to you is to
            nail<br>
            that shift in hand position. The listener should not be able to tell that you shifted positions. In fact<br>
            once you feel comfortable with the shift, do it without looking at the guitar, perfect this so that you
            can<br>
            do it without any problems
        </p>
