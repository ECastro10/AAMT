        Remember how in the last chapter we discovered that there were only so many major, minor, or diminished chords<br>
        per key? When you make chords from the available notes in a major scale, this is known as <b>harmonizing a major scale</b>.<br>
        You are free to call these <b>chord families</b> as well because these family patterns are specific to each key.

    <h3>
        Triad Chord Families
    </h3>

    <p>
        To recap some notes from last chapter, there are only three major triads, three minor triads, and one diminished triad<br>
        per key. So how do achieve this number? Simply create a chord out of every note in that scale. Since there are only<br>
        seven notes per major scale, there can only be seven chords. This image illustrate the concept.

        Shortcut to remembering chord families, first though, know the notes in that major scale. The pattern for chords<br>
        starting from the root note and on:<br><br>
        <b>Major, Minor, Minor, Major, Major, Minor, Diminished.</b><br><br>
        This pattern works for all keys. Try writing out the chord families for all the keys. You will notice how different<br>
        shuffle throughout all the keys.<br>
        Here is what the C major scale family looks like on a staff.<br><br>
        <b>NOTE: From here on out, we will refer to the chords in each chord family by numbers.<br>
        example: I chord == C Major, II Chord == D minor, III chord == E minor, ..., VII chord == B diminished.</b>
