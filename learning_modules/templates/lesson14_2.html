        Let's take a look at the second mode known as the <b>Dorian Mode.</b>
    </p>

    <h3>Dorian Mode</h3>

    <p>
        <b>Dorian Mode:<br>
        1 - 2 - b3 - 4 - 5 - [6] - b7<br>
        Unique Note: 6</b><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's discuss this a bit.<br>
        In order to achieve the same notes in a key but starting and ending on the second note, we have to first change<br>
        the root name and then the mode name.<br><br>

        <b>example: C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C == C Ionian<br>
        D - E - F# - G - A - B - C# - D == D Ionian</b><br><br>

        Notice how at this point the notes are not the same? That is because we are still in the first mode, the intervals<br>
        are not appropriate for this layout. We need to flatten following:<br>
        <b>3rd & 7th scale degrees</b><br>
        It just so happens that the Dorian mode has this formula.<br><br>

        <b>example: D - E - F# - G - A - B - C# - D == D Ionian<br>
        D - E - F - G - A - B - C - D == D Dorian</b><br><br>

        See how that worked. The basic layout of each mode (or formula, whichever you prefer) allows this new scale<br>
        to have different starting and ending points while still maintaining the same notes in the key that you want.<br><br>

        Let's see how it looks like on the fretboard by itself and then with the Ionian Mode.

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="dorian-mode-pattern-6th-string">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/dorian-mode-pattern-6th-string.jpeg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>
        <p class="center-key">
            <b>
                Key:<br>
                Green == Mode root<br>
                Red == Regular Root<br>
                Yellow == Unique Notes<br><br>

                The rest of the diagrams in the mode chapter will follow this key.<br>
                This key is here so that you understand the relationships between the mode, the key, and the unique notes.
            </b>
        </p>

    <p>
        So here is the Dorian pattern with the initial root on the 6th string, nothing too crazy.
    </p>
        <br>
        <br>

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="dorian-mode-pattern-5th-string">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/dorian-mode-pattern-5th-string.jpeg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="center-key">
        The shift:<br>
        <b>The shift occurs on the 3rd string (G string)<br>
        The green note (mode root) should be hit with your pointer finger.</b>
    </p>
        <br>

    <p>
        And here is the big pattern if you combine the Ionian and Dorian modes but focus on the key or original root note.
    </p>

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="ionian-dorian">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/ionian-plus-dorian-pattern.jpeg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>

   <p>
        Now that you know two modes, practice them, and focus on those unique notes to hear the differences.<br>
        However if you don't want to treat the green notes as home base and hear the green notes, you can treat the red notes as home base<br>
        and basically have an expanded range to play the Ionian Mode.<br>
        The main takeaway is that we are expanding our knowledge on the fretboard and introducing<br>
        new focal points.
