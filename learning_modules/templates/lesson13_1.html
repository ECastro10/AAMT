    <p>Alright, time to add some color to your basic triads. Let's talk about seventh chords.</p>

    <h3>Turning Triads into 7th chords</h3>

    <p>
        The basic gist of 7th chords is to stack another interval on top of your triads. That being said, <br>
        you need at least 4 special notes to have a full 7th chord but you do not need them all, this concept<br>
        of removing notes will be discussed later on.<br>
        <br>
        Quick Recap. In any key you have the following triad types: Major, Minor, Augmented, and Diminished.<br>
        The Formulas were: 1-3-5, 1-b3-5, 1-3-#5, and 1-b3-b5.<br>
        For 7th chords we will talk about 6 types of chords:<br>
        <ul>
        <b><li>Major 7th ([note]Maj7)</li>
            <li>Dominant 7th ([note]dom7 == [note]7)</li>
            <li>Minor 7th ([note]min7)</li>
            <li>Minor 7 flat 5([note]min7b5 == [note]half-diminished)</li>
            <li>Full Diminished 7th([note]dim7)</li>
            <li>Minor/Major 7th ([note]min(Maj7))</li></b>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        We won't dive into the sounds of the chords but we will discuss what triad type they extend from, formulas<br>
        for constructing them, show an example of each one with a C root, chords inside of the 7th, and interval spacing.<br>
        <b>The common root is there to show how the chord type differs from the others with the same root.</b>><br>
    </p>

    <h3>Major 7th</h3>

    <p>
        The Major 7th is an extension of the major triad(1 - 3 - 5)<br>
        <b>FORMULA: 1 - 3 - 5 - 7<br>
            example: CMajor7 == C - E - G - B<br>
        Chords Inside: First 3 notes == CMajor and the last 3 notes == Eminor.<br>
        Intervals:<br>
            1 <-> 3 == 4 semitones<br>
            3 <-> 5 == 3 semitones<br>
            5 <-> 7 == 4 semitones</b>
    </p>

    <h3>Dominant 7th</h3>

    <p>
        The Dominant 7th is an extension of the major triad(1 - 3 - 5)<br>
        <b>FORMULA: 1 - 3 - 5 - b7<br>
            example: Cdom7 or C7 == C - E - G - Bb<br>
        Chords Inside: First 3 notes == CMajor and last 3 notes == Ediminished<br>
        Intervals:<br>
            1 <-> 3 == 4 semitones<br>
            3 <-> 5 == 3 semitones<br>
            5 <-> b7 == 3 semitones</b>
    </p>

        <h3>Minor 7th</h3>

    <p>
        The Minor 7th is an extension of the minor triad(1 - b3 - 5)<br>
        <b>FORMULA: 1 - b3 - 5 - b7<br>
            example: Cmin7 == C - Eb - G - Bb<br>
        Chords Inside: First 3 notes == Cminor and last 3 notes == Eb Major<br>
        Intervals:<br>
            1 <-> b3 == 3 semitones<br>
            b3 <-> 5 == 4 semitones<br>
            5 <-> b7 == 3 semitones</b>
    </p>

        <h3>Minor 7 flat 5 aka Half-Diminished</h3>

    <p>
        The minor7b5 is an extension of the diminished triad(1 - b3 - b5)<br>
        <b>FORMULA: 1 - b3 - b5 - b7<br>
            example: Cmin7b5 == C - Eb - Gb - Bb<br>
        Chords Inside: First 3 notes == C diminished and last 3 notes == Ebminor<br>
        Intervals:<br>
            1 <-> b3 == 3 semitones<br>
            b3 <-> b5 == 3 semitones<br>
            b5 <-> b7 == 4 semitones</b>
    </p>

        <h3>Full-Diminished 7th</h3>

    <p>
        The Full-Diminished 7th is an extension of the diminished triad(1 - b3 - b5)<br>
        The fully diminished 7th is the first time we use a double flat. Flatten twice or by a tone == 2 semitones.<br>
        <b>FORMULA: 1 - b3 - b5 - bb7<br>
            example: Cdim7 == C - Eb - Gb - Bbb (A)<br>
        Chords Inside: First 3 notes == Cdiminished and last 3 notes == Ebdiminished<br>
        Intervals:<br>
        1 <-> b3 == 3 semitones<br>
        b3 <-> b5 == 3 semitones<br>
        b5 <-> bb7 == 3 semitones</b>
    </p>

        <h3>Minor/Major 7th</h3>

    <p>
        The minor/Major 7th is an extension of the minor triad(1 - 3 - 5)
        <b>FORMULA: 1 - b3 - 5 - 7<br>
            example: Cm/Maj7 == C - Eb - G - B<br>
        Chords Inside: First 3 notes == Cminor and last 3 notes == Ebaugmented<br>
        Intervals:<br>
        1 <-> b3 == 3 semitones<br>
        b3 <-> 5 == 4 semitones<br>
        5 <-> 7 == 4 semitones</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        These formulas and chord types should give you plenty of new sounds to explore.<br>
        Please do note how you find different triads inside these chords, this will help you to understand<br>
        the sound a bit and why give you something to help you memorize the formulas.<br>
        <b>NOTE: For memorizing the types of chords in 7ths, don't memorize the note of the triads inside<br>
        just memorize the types of chords found inside the 7ths.</b>
