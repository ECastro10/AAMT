        Let's dive into the <b>harmonic minor scale</b>

    <p>
        The image above shows the A harmonic minor scale up and down one octave but it captures the essence of<br>
        sharpening that 7th degree in our scale.<br>
        Now let's see how a two octave pattern looks like on the guitar fretboard.

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="harmonic-minor-scale">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/harmonic_minor_scale.jpeg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        If you haven't already noticed, this is basically the natural minor scale with a sharpened 7th == #7.<br>
        This raised 7th gives it an almost a foreign sound.<br>
        We raise that 7th so that it sounds more harmonious with dominant chords which we will cover next chapter.<br>
        Recall how the major scale has this single semitone difference between the 7th and the Root.<br>
        To maneuver through this scale requires only one shift.<br>
        Do the shift however you want but make sure it happens in a way that allows you to play the top three strings (G, B, E)<br>
        in one position. And remember, one finger per note, at least for now.
