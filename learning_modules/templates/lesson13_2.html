    <p>Quick recap of the triad chord family:<br>
    Major, Minor, Minor, Major, Major, Minor, Diminished.<br>
    In this lesson we will dive further into 7ths territory and which ones occur naturally in keys.</p>

    <h3>7ths Diatonic Chord Family</h3>

    <p>Remember last lesson how we introduced six 7th chords?<br>
    Well, we can only achieve 4 of those in a key.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Key of C == C, D, E, F, G, A, B</b><br>
        To understand why the following pattern works you have to fundamentally understand intervals.<br>
        I assume that at this point you do so let's make this quick.<br>
        We will be using scale degrees rather than intervals (which we went over last lesson) to make chords.<br>
        That being said, here we go.
    </p>

    <p>
        The basic idea with any chord inside a chord family is to basically use every other note.<br>
        C,<strike> D,</strike> E,<strike> F,</strike> G,<strike> A,</strike> B == <b>C, E, G, B == CMajor7</b><br><br>

        Next we start from D<br>
        D,<strike> E,</strike> F,<strike> G,</strike> A,<strike> B,</strike> C == <b>D, F, A, C == Dminor7</b><br><br>

        Next E<br>
        E,<strike> F,</strike> G,<strike> A,</strike> B,<strike> C,</strike> D == <b>E, G, B, D == Eminor7</b><br><br>

        Next F<br>
        F,<strike> G,</strike> A,<strike> B,</strike> C,<strike> D,</strike> E == <b>F, A, C, E == FMajor7</b><br><br>

        Next G<br>
        G,<strike> A,</strike> B,<strike> C,</strike> D,<strike> E,</strike> F == <b>G, B, D, F == G7</b><br><br>

        Next A<br>
        A,<strike> B,</strike> C,<strike> D,</strike> E,<strike> F,</strike> G == <b>A, C, E, G == Aminor7</b><br><br>

        Next B<br>
        B,<strike> C,</strike> D,<strike> E,</strike> F,<strike> G,</strike> A == <b>B, D, F, A == Bm7b5</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        And that is the 7ths Chord Family. Notice how there are no fully diminished, or minor/majors in there.<br>
        So the same pattern essentially exists except that now all your V chords are dominants and your VII chords are<br>
        minor7b5. Practice these chords sequentially and they should sound good together. Also, go back to the chord<br>
        progressions lesson and try mixing in 7ths or playing all in 7ths until you find a good balance.
