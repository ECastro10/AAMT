        Alright, let's build on our triads to make some interesting sounding chords.<br>
        It is worth noting that 6th chords are not traditional in the sense of how we have been building<br>
        chords. Let's dive into why and how 6th chords are built.
    </p>

    <h3>Major 6th</h3>

    <p>
        We will discuss to basic types of 6th chords, the major 6th and the minor 6th.<br>
        There are more types of 6th chords out there but we will focus on the basic types.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's build a 6th Major Chord.<br>
        <b>FORMULA: 1 - 3 - 5 - 6</b>
    </p>

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="major6-chord-staff">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/c-major-6th-chord-on-treble-clef.png' %}">
        </div>
    </div>
        <br>

    <p>
        The reason that 6th chords are not traditional is because it breaks the pattern of thirds.<br>
        As you can see, the sixth scale degree does not stack directly on top, if 6ths kept to tradition,<br>
        the sixth note would stack on top of the first three notes quite nicely, but those are 7ths which we will<br>
        discuss in the next chapter.<br>
        Use the scale degrees and the formula to get any Major 6th chord.
    </p>

    <h3>Minor 6th</h3>

    <p>
        <b>FORMULA: 1 - b3 - 5 - 6</b>
    </p>

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="minor6-chord-staff">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/f-minor-6th-chord-on-treble-clef.png' %}">
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>

    <p>
        Overall, 6th chords sound interesting but they do not occur naturally in chord families. In the next chapter<br>
        we will discuss the 7th's chord family to prove our point.
