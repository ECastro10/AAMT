        Remember how on the cumulative pattern we have omitted the minor scale extension?<br>
        Well this is why, the sixth mode is actually the minor scale.
    </p>

    <h3>Aeolian (Minor) Mode</h3>

    <p>
        <b>Aeolian Mode:
        1 - 2 - b3 - 4 - 5 - [b6] - b7<br>
        Unique Note: b6</b><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Since you already know 6th string root pattern, we will skip that one and go straight to<br>
        the 5th string root pattern.<br>
        Just remember that for the 6th string pattern to visualize the unique note and the mode root.
    </p>

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="minor-5th-string">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/minor-scale-5th-string.jpeg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        As you noticed this pattern has no shift but you could easily make one that has a shift.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="all-modes">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/combined-modes.jpeg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Remember how the lydian scale didn't extend the cumulative pattern, well the next mode, locrian<br>
        is only a semitone away from aeolian so it will not make a difference considering that I put <br>
        the aeolian mode before the ionian.<br>
        Therefore, here you go, a pattern that stretches 15 frets and has all the modes.<br>
        Congratulations!
