    <p>
        Before we dive into any chord sequences, let's talk about why we use diatonic chord sequences.<br>
        <b>Diatonic means within a key or scale</b><br>
        Songs have a general chord sequences to that they adhere to, this means that they will repeat this chord<br>
        sequence however many times until they reach a break in between the sequence or the end of the song.<br>
        These are not the end all be all because you can modulate between keys which means changing keys (we won't discuss in this chapter).<br>
        Explore as many of these sequences as you can in all keys to hear what the sequences sound like.

    <p>
        In terms of how to play them, play them the same way you played the cadences.

    <p>
        Set your metronome at a comfortable speed and practice in 4/4 time at first, playing each chord for one bar.<br>
        You can also look up other chord progressions if you'd like.
