    <div class="lesson_wrapper">
    
    <p>Fourth Mode, it is worth noting that since Lydian is only a semitone away from phrygian, the patterns<br>
    will look extremely similar. In fact we will not show the combined modes on this one<br>
    because the pattern at the end of phrygian includes the Lydian pattern.</p>

    <h3>Lydian Mode</h3>

    <p>
        <b>Lydian Mode:
        1 - 2 - 3 - [#4] - 5 - 6 - 7<br>
        Unique Note: #4</b><br><br>

        The Lydian Mode allows us to start and end on the fourth note in any Key. In this case <br>
        it would be F in the key of C.<br><br>

        <b>example: F - G - A - Bb - C - D - E - F == F Ionian<br>
        F - G - A - B - C - D - E - F == F Lydian</b><br><br>

        Now let's look at the patterns.
    </p>

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="Lydian-6th-string">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/lydian-6th-string.jpeg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>
        And now the 5th string pattern that has the same shift on the 3rd string.
    </p>

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="lydian-5th-string">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/lydian-5th-string.jpeg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Now you know the fourth mode and as you noticed, not a huge difference between this one and Phrygian.
    </p>
    
    
    
    
    </div>
