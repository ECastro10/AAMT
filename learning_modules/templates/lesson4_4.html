    <h3>Tempo Markings</h3>

    <p>
        Some music pieces can be played at different tempos but some songs cannot, it is for this reason that we have <br>
        tempo markings on sheet music. You will find the tempo markings on the top left above the first staff and clef.<br>
        Here are some examples of what you might find.
    </p>

    <h3>Dynamic Markings</h3>
    <p>
        Dynamics are an important part of music, they are the high or soft points in music.<br>
        Writing in standard notation allows us to be able to convey to any reader the dynamics of our musical piece.<br>
        Here are some examples that you might see.
    </p>

    <div id="dynamics">
        <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/dynamicsmarkings.gif' %}">
    </div>
    <p>
        This is pretty self explanatory, if you need some examples for levels of volume, use the power of google.<br>
        Let's look at how this might look on some sheet paper.

        If the last set of whole notes puzzle you, it is okay. We did not go over these, they are known as<br>
        <b>double whole notes</b>. They are exactly what they sound like, two whole notes.
    </p>
    <p>
        You might see dynamics markings with angles in between them to represent the rise and fall of volume. <br>

    <p> Here are the notes of the open strings on the guitar to understand where those strings are on a treble staff.<br>
        Now that you have an understanding on the many aspects of sheet music, read and write sheet music as often as<br>
        you can to become "literate". Click <a href="{% static 'images/printable-treble-cleff-staff.png' %}">HERE</a> for empty treble clef staves sheets.<br>
        Now it's time to explore all the keys and how they are created.
