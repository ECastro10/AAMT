    <p>
        Before we go into constructing chords, let's go over <b>intervals.</b><br>
        When we talk about <b>intervals</b> we are usually referring to the <b>space between notes.</b><br>
        Remember why the circle of fifths/fourths is named? That was an example of intervals. When going clockwise<br>
        your next key will be a fifth higher, if going counter clockwise it will be a fourth.<br>
        The smallest space or interval between two notes is a semitone == to one fret.<br>
        Here is a chart with all the names of the intervals.
    </p>


    <div id="intervals-chart">

    </div>
    <br>
    
    <p>
        If 1 fret == 1 semitone, that means that that the octave of a note is 12 frets away (the octave being on the 12th fret).<br>
        Next is a couple of staves with the all the intervals on them.
    </p>

    </div>
        <br>

    <p>
        So all of these spaces between notes, up to the same note itself have a name, cool, so what?<br>
        These intervals are characterized by sound difference. That is to say that each interval sounds different.<br>
        I highly recommend that you practice your intervals and try playing both notes together to hear what sounds good.<br>
        If you can't remember all of the names, that is fine, for the time being just remember the followig<br>
        <b>Major 2nd<br>
           Major 3rd<br>
           Perfect 4th<br>
           Perfect 5th<br>
           Major 7th</b>
    </p>
    
    
    
    
    </div>
