    <h1 class="center_title">Intro to Modes/ Ionian Mode (Major)</h1>

    <div class="lesson_wrapper">

    <p>
        We briefly touched the concept of modes a while ago when exploring minor scales but we didn't really go into depth.<br>
        So let's discuss the concept of modes before diving into our <b>7 modes.</b>
    </p>

    <h3>What is a mode?</h3>

    <p>
        In short, a mode dictates the first notes, last note, and the interval spacing. <br>
        Let me explain with an example. <br><br>

        <b>example: in the key of C
        Notes: C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C == C Ionian Mode (first mode)
        D - E - F - G - A - B - C - D == D "second" Mode<br>
        E - F - G - A - B - C - D - E == E "third" Mode<br>
        F - G - A - B - C - D - E - F == F "fourth" Mode <br>
        ...<br>
        ...<br>
        B - C - D - E - F - G - A - B == B "seventh" Mode</b><br><br>

        Notice how we are keeping the same notes in the key of C but just changing where the scale begins and ends?<br>
        This concept is known as modes. I did not include the actual names of the modes because we will learn them<br>
        in the order, first, second, third, etc...<br>
        There are a few key points that you must understand.<br><br>

        <b>Each mode is unique because the intervals needed to maintain the same notes as the key are different.<br>
        example: C - D == 1 whole tone difference<br>
        E - F == 1 semitone difference</b><br>
        This shows how the formula for the first mode is different from the third mode.<br><br>

        <b>Because of these unique interval placements, each mode has a unique note that makes it stand out<br>
        from the other modes.<br><br>
        It is impossible to stay in the key of C and have C Ionian mode and C second mode or any other mode with the C root.<br>
        This is so because of the reason above, each mode has a unique set of intervals. This will become more evident as<br>
        you learn more modes.<br><br>
        Lastly, the format for modes are as follows<br>
        "Note name" "Mode Name"<br>
        example: C Ionian<br><br></b>

        Okay, let's go into our first mode, Ionian (Major) Mode.
    </p>

    <h3>Ionian Mode (Major)</h3>

    <p>
        Great News! You already know the first mode!<br>
        How? Well think about it if you start and end on the root note in any key, you end up with a major scale.<br>
        It just so happens that the first mode is the major scale. This is why (Major) is next to the Ionian Mode<br>
        at the top of the page and this section.<br>
        Ionian Mode is the first mode and it is the template that you modify to get all other modes.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Ionian Mode:
        1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - [7]<br>
        Unique Note: 7</b><br><br>
        That is just about all the information you need to know. As you learn more modes, pay close attention<br>
        to that unique note and how the numbers are modified.<br>
        Besides that, congratulations, you know the Ionian Mode.
    </p>
