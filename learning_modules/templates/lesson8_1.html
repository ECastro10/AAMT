        Before we dive into the first cadence, let's discuss what a cadence is.
    </p>

    <h3>
        What is a Cadence?
    </h3>

    <p>
        A <b>cadence</b> is simply a group of chords the resolve a musical piece.<br>
        In other terms, a cadence gives you that feeling that the song has reached its end or at least a pause.<br>
        Chances are that you have heard at least one of the cadences. Practice them to get their respective feels.
        This chapter will explore a few cadences in the key of C, but remember to practice them in all keys.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Authentic Cadence
    </h3>

    <p>
        <b>SEQUENCE: V - I<br>
        SOUND: Strong Resolution, sense of finality.</b><br>
        The first cadence requires the V chord and the I chord.<br>
        The idea is to play the V chord and then the I chord. In the key of C it would be G Major followed by C Major.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>
        Plagal Cadence
    </h3>

    <p>
        <b>SEQUENCE: IV - I<br>
        SOUND: Strong resolution but weaker than an authentic cadence</b><br>
        In the Key of C you would play F Major followed by a C Major.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Half Cadence
    </h3>

    <p>
        <b>SEQUENCE: ? - V<br>
        SOUND: incomplete or suspended, it is considered a weak cadence that calls for continuation.</b><br>
        The ? means that you can use any chord of any type. Explore any and all possibilities but remember<br>
        that you cannot go wrong with any chords in the chord family.<br>
        example: E minor to a G Major.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Deceptive Cadence
    </h3>

    <p>
        <b>SEQUENCE: V - VI<br>
        SOUND: Deceptive as the name implies. Explained below</b><br>
        The reason that this cadence is effective in being deceptive is because the V chord will always want to resolve<br>
        to the I chord. So when you play the V, our ears expect the I. You can substitute the VI chord with others, except the I.<br>
        You will notice that some chords just don't fit, when in doubt just fallback onto the VI.<br>
        As is, this would be a G Major followed by an A minor.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Interrupted Cadence
    </h3>

    <p>
        <b>SEQUENCE: V - ?m - I<br>
        SOUND: Misdirection but ultimately resolves, not a strong resolve as an authentic cadence</b><br>
        The ?m means any minor chord, preferably one in the chord family. The basic idea with this cadence is to<br>
        setup an authentic cadence with the V chord, redirect to a minor chord, and return back to the I chord.<br>
        example: G Major, to a D minor, to a C Major.
    </p>


    <p>
        These are just a few cadences that you can utilize when creating your own music. Practice all of them and try<br>
        substituting chords to hear how they sound but still adhering to that relative cadence.
    </p>
