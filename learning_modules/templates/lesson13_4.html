    <h1 class="center_title">Building Extended Chords</h1>

    <div class="lesson_wrapper">

    <p>
        Chances are that you have heard of other chords besides the chords that we have discussed.<br>
        If not, there are 9th chords, 11ths, 13ths, and variations amongst those named.<br>
        Once you get past 7th chords, they become extended chords. Although there are non extended chords<br>
        that have an extended note added.<br>
        example: 6/9 == Major 6 add 9.<br>
        Lastly, there are also variations to non extended chords that we did not go over but the formulas<br>
        are available on the <a href="{% url 'theory' %}"><b>theory page.</b></a>

    <h3>What is an Extended Chord</h3>

    <p>
        What makes a chord extended is easier to understand with an example.
        <br><br>
        <b>Key of C: C, D, E, F, G, A, B</b><br>
        Here you have your notes in the key of C. When it comes to chords we can create, the most<br>
        diverse chords that we know only require 4 of these notes inside the same octave.<br>
        Remember how in scale degrees C == 1, D == 2, E == 3, etc..?<br>
        With one octave you can only have 7 scale degrees hence why you get those 7ths.<br>
        To get extended chords, you have to extend that scale past that single octave.<br><br>
        <b>example: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B</b><br>
        Here we have C == 1, ... B == 7, C == 8, D == 9, E == 10, ... B == 14.<br>
        Notice how instead of starting back at one on the C you continue counting?<br>
        You are extending that scale. You only go up to the 13th because after that you basically start<br>
        repeating again. If this were to happen, you would be playing octaves.<br>
        With extended chords, you will notice that some notes become optional which allows you to play<br>
        smaller shapes.<br>
        I won't dive into how to build them because there are so many extended chords, but there is a<br>
        cheat sheet on the <a href="{% url 'theory' %}"><b>theory page.</b></a> Just scroll down until you get to chord construction formulas.<br>
        I recommend exploring these chord types when you are having trouble finding the sound that you want.
