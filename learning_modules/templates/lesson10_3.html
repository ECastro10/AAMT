    <p>
        One of the final variations of the minor scale is known as the <b>Melodic Minor Scale.</b><br>
        This is a whole new level of playing scale.<br>
        The concept is to play up the scale one way and play down the scale another.<br>
        This ideology stems from the need to play a certain scale on the upbeat and then a different scale<br>
        on the downbeat.

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Going up the scale looks familiar because it is like the harmonic minor scale except with a raised 6th.<br>
        This modified harmonic minor scale looks like this.<br>
    </p>
        <div class="center-image-wrapper">
            <div id="melodic-minor-pattern">
                <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/melodic_minor_scale.jpeg' %}">
            </div>
        </div>
    <p>
        At this point you should be able to see that there is a shift in this modified scale and you should be able<br>
        to maneuver through it yourself. Remember, try not to use the same finger for two back to back notes if possible.
        Once you reach that next octave A, you then play down the scale in the natural minor manner.

        <b>NOTES: As mentioned before all of our patterns so far have been two octave patterns, <br>
            you can play up one octave and then switch to the minor while continuing up,<br>
            you can play up one octave and then back down that same octave in a minor fashion,<br>
            or you can play two octaves in the modified manor and back down in a minor for two octaves.<br>
            It is entirely up to you but I think the chords being played in behind you will dictate how long<br>
            you can play either of the scales in the melodic minor scale.<br>
            Remember, practice, practice, practice.</b>
