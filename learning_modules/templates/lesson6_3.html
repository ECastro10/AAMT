    <p>
        For suspended chords you have to remember one more interval, the perfect 4th.<br>
        Remember how the 3rd dictated whether a chord was major or minor? Well with suspended chords you tamper with the 3rd.<br>
        Let's dive in.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Suspended chords formula
    </h3>

    <p>
        There two basic kinds of suspended chords: the suspended 4th (sus4) and the suspended 2nd (sus2).<br>
        The reason they are suspended is because we change the major 3rd to a perfect 4th or major 2nd.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>
        Suspended 4th
    </h3>

    <p>
        <b>FORMULA: 1 - 4 - 5</b>
        In order to achieve the suspended 4th all you have to do is sharpen the 3rd in a major chord == major 3rd -- > perfect 4th.<br>
        Or double sharpen the 3rd in a minor chord == minor 3rd -- > major 3rd -- > perfect 4th.<br>
        Very simply move, just move the finger that is on the 3rd up one fret.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>
        Suspended 2nd
    </h3>

    <p>
        <b>FORMULA: 1 - 2 - 5</b>
        In order to achieve the suspended 2nd you have to double flatten the 3rd in a major chord == major 3rd --> minor 3rd --> major 2nd.<br>
        Or simply flatten the third in a minor chord == minor 3rd --> major 2nd.
    </p>

    <p>
        Both of these chords give you the suspended feel and sound because they are neither major nor minor.<br>
        Play with suspended chords, you will find that they can expand your vocabulary of sound when playing just a major or minor chord.
