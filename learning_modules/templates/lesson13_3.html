    <p>
        Time for one of my favorite lessons, arpeggios.<br>
        An arpeggio is the spelling out of a chord. What do I mean by that? Well let's talk about that.
    </p>

    <h3>Concept of an Arpeggio</h3>

    <p>
        Suppose you take the word "dollar", to spell the word "dollar", you would spell it like so<br>
        "d - o - l - l - a - r". Easy right?<br>
        Well that is all an arpeggio is. You take a chord and spell it out. A chord is when you play <br>
        a group of notes together at the same time, an arpeggio is basically spelling out that chord by playing<br>
        each note in that chord sequentially rather than at the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will discuss 7ths arpeggios because they go over our basic triads (excluding suspended chords).<br>
        We will go over arpeggios with the root on the 6th and 5th string.
    </p>

    <h3>Major 7th Arpeggio</h3>

    <p>
        Remember the formula for a Major 7th? Well, if you don't, make it a point to memorize them.<br>
        <b>FORMULA: 1 - 3 - 5 - 7</b>
    </p>

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="major-7-arpeggio-6th-string">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/major7_arpeggio_6th_string.jpeg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        As usual all our patterns will span two octaves.<br>
        This pattern requires no pattern because it stays confined to four frets. Play this pattern 6th - 1st string (low E -- > high E)<br>
        then back down. The idea is to build muscle memory and speed. These arpeggios might be your bread and butter.<br>
        One last note before we continue on, once you get the hang of playing these at moderate speeds, try to visualize<br>
        scales underneath these arpeggios to break out of the confines of arpeggio patterns.<br>
        These exercises should keep you occupied for a while.<br>
        <br>
        Now, the 5th string root pattern.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="major-7-arpeggio-5th-string">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/major7_arpeggio_5th_string.jpeg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Alright, the shift here occurs on the 3rd string == g string.<br>
        You will play the note before the root with your ring finger, then the root with your pointer.<br>
        This breaks the convention a bit because you have to play the root and the following 3rd with the same finger<br>
        but this is efficient because your finger does not have to shift position.<br><br>
        When playing back down (high E to A), the shift is identical except in reverse.
    </p>

    <h3>Dominant 7th Arpeggio</h3>

    <p>
        <b>
            FORMULA: 1 - 3 - 5 - b7
        </b>
    </p>

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="dominant-7-arpeggio-6th-string">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/dom7_arpeggio_6th_string.jpeg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        As you have noticed, this pattern spans 5 frets. That means a possible shift.<br>
        You can stretch rather than shift, but shifting makes life easier.<br>
        The 6th and 5th strings are played normally, but you should shift on the 4th string == D string.<br>
        Shift up the fretboard one fret to be able to play that note before the root with your pointer finger.<br>
        The shift should be the same but in reverse playing back down to the 6th string.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="dominant-7-arpeggio-5th-string">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/dom7_arpeggio_5th_string.jpeg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        The shift on the dom7 arpeggio is identical to the one on major7 arpeggio. The root note in between<br>
        both octaves should be played with the pointer finger.
    </p>

    <h3>Minor 7th Arpeggio</h3>

    <p>
        <b>
            FORMULA: 1 - b3 - 5 - b7
        </b>
    </p>

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="minor-7-arpeggio-6th-string">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/minor7_arpeggio_6th_string.jpeg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        This pattern requires no shift but it does require the barring of two strings or shifting of pressure,<br>
        whatever you choose to call it.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="minor-7-arpeggio-5th-string">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/minor7_arpeggio_5th_string.jpeg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        The shift on this pattern occurs on the 2nd string == B string. Play from the root up to the 2nd string.<br>
        On the 2nd string, play that first note with your pointer finger. After that, stretch that pinky out to<br>
        get that next note. The last two notes on the 1st string might be a challenge to maneuver after the stretch.<br>
        I recommend practicing the 2nd and 1st string by themselves, going up and down until your fingers get<br>
        comfortable maneuvering the stretch and the notes nearby. Good luck.
    </p>

    <h3>Minor 7 Flat 5 Arpeggio</h3>

    <p>
        <b>
            FORMULA: 1 - b3 - b5 - b7
        </b>
    </p>

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="minor-7b5-arpeggio-6th-string">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/mino7b5_arpeggio_6th_string.jpeg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Similar to previous patterns, you will need to barre two strings to get fluid and even sound.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="center-image-wrapper">
        <div id="minor-7b5-arpeggio-5th-string">
            <img class="nat_img_size" src="{% static 'images/mino7b5_arpeggio_5th_string.jpeg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        This shift is similar to the minor 7th, 5th string root pattern.<br>
        However, I noticed that if I played that note on the 2nd string that is in the fret between the two notes<br>
        on the first string, that my pinky had some issues. If you have this issue I recommend playing that note with<br>
        your ring finger so that your middle and pinky fingers can move independently around the ring finger.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>NOTES: Practice these slowly until you can play them without looking at your guitar or even without thinking.<br>
        Once you get that down, increase the speed. Besides sounding fun, they give you some ground<br>
        on what to play over chords, because if someone is playing an Amin7, you can just play around the arpeggio<br>
        and it will not sound bad.<br>
        Try playing these with the same root to hear and feel the difference.</b>
