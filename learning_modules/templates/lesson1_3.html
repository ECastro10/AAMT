    <div class="lesson_wrapper">
    <p class="">Now that you know the names of the open strings on your guitar, it is time to see if you are in tune<br>
    If you have a tuner at home feel free to use it, if not, go to the home page and click on the tile that says "tuner".<br>
    Now start from your <b>sixth string == low E string</b>. Pluck it and let it ring while the tuner is one.<br>
    The following table shows you the frequencies you want to hit for each string.</p>

    <p>All tuned up? Here's a fun technique to hear how two notes that are an octave apart sound.</p>

    <div id="guitar_octaves">
        <div class="nat_img_size">
            <img src="{% static 'images/octaves.jpg' %}">
        </div>
    </div>
        <p>The left most part of each picture is the <b>sixth string == low E == thickest string.</b><br>
        Practice all of these patterns and start thinking about string relationships.<br>
        By string relationships I mean the distance relationships for the same note.<br>
        Besides that, practice these shapes everyday for a nice thick sound with only 1 note!</p>
